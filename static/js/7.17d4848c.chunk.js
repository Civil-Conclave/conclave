It is imperative for every structural engineer to learn how to incorporate the above two elements in the design of the structure. This problem is a step ahead in this direction and it requires for the participants to ensure the stability of a building by checking the adequacy of design as per IS Codes and estimate its behaviour in case of an occurrence of Earthquake. This also invites the suggestion of participants regarding changes to make the design economical. The last portion of the problem is an attempt to engage participants to come out with a new technology of material estimation which is user-friendly and viable in all aspects.",image:v,problem:b},{title:"Rejuvenating River Ganga",date:"21, March 2020",description:'In India, the water of River Ganga is treated with utmost reverence. This is because of the cultural as well functional significance of the river. It is the life support system for innumerable organisms in our country. This reverence  has not, however, prevented over-use, abuse, and pollution of the river. The rise of this problem in the last few years has made the Government of India take several initiatives for rejuvenation of the river. From Engineering point of view one principal problem highlighted has been "Sludge Management".This Case Study invites participating institutes to come up with a technology for efficient use of sludge.
